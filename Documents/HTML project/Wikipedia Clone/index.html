          <p>The <strong>Roc</strong> is an enormous legendary <a href="#">bird of prey</a> in the popular mythology of the <a href="#">Middle East</a></p>
          <p>The Roc appears in Arabic geographies and natural history, popularized in Arabian fairy tales and sailors' folklore. <a href="#">Ibn Battuta</a> tells of a mountain hovering in the air over China Seas, which was the Roc.<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup> The story collection <a href="#">One Thousand and One Nights</a> includes tales of <a href="#">Abd al-Rahman</a> and <a href="#">Sinbad the Sailor</a>, both of which include the Roc.

        <h2>Etymology</h2>
        <article class="etymology">
          <p>
            The English form <i>roc</i> originates via <a href="#">Antoine Galland</a>'s French from Arabic <i>ruḵḵ</i> (<a href="#">Arabic: الرُخّ‎,</a> <small><a href="#">romanized:</a> <i>ar-ruḫḫ</i></small>) and that from <a href="#">Persian</a> <i>ruḵ</i> (<small>Persian pronunciation: <a href="#">[/rux/]</a></small>).<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup> In both languages, Arabic and Persian, the word is written in the <a href="#">Arabic script</a> as <strong>رخ</strong>. Common <a href="#">romanizations</a> are <i>ruḵḵ</i> for the Arabic form <sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup> and <i>ruḵ,</i><sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup> rokh or rukh for the Persian form. Despite the similarities and sometimes claims to the contrary, the word is not realted to the English word <a href="#"><i>rook</i></a>.

        <h2>Eastern origins</h2>
        <article class="eastern-origins">
          <p>
            According to art historian <a href="#">Rudolf Wittkower</a>, the idea of the roc had its origins in the story of the fight between the Indian solar bird Garuda <sup><a href="#">[3]</a></sup> and the <a href="#">chthonic</a> serpent <a href="#">Nāga</a>. The <a href="#">mytheme</a> of Garuda carrying off and elephant that was battling a crocodile appears in two Sanskrit epics, the <a href="#"><i>Mahabhaarata</i></a> (I. 1353) and the <a href="#"><i>Ramayana</i></a> (III.39).

        <h2>Western expansion</h2>
        <article class="western-expansion">
          <p>
            Rabbi <a href="#">Benjamin of Tudela</a> reported a story reminiscent of the roc inwhich shipwrecked sailors escaped from a desert island by wrappind themselves in ox-hides and letting <a href="#">griffins</a> carry them off as if they were cattle.<sup><a href="#">[4]</a></sup>
          </p>
          <p>In the 13th century, <a href="#">Marco Polo</a> (as quoted in <a href="#">Attenborough</a>(1961 : 32)) stated</p>
            <blockquote cite="http://">
              It was for all the world like an eagle, but one indeed of enormous size; so big in fast that its quills were twelve paces long and thick in proportion. And it is so strong that it will seize an elephant in its talons and carry him high into the air and drop him so that he is smashed to pieces; having killed him, the bird swoops down on him and eats him at leisure.
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              Polo claimed that the roc flew to <a href="#">Madagascar</a> "from the southern regions", and that the <a href="#">Great Khan</a> sent messengers to the island who returned with a feather (likely a <a href="#"><i>Raphia</i></a> frond). <sup><a href="#">[5]</a></sup> He explicitly distinguishes the bird from a griffin.
            </p>
            <p>
              In <a href="#"><i>The Arabian Nights</i></a> the roc appears on a tropical island during <a href="#">Sinbad</a>'s second voyage. Becayse of Polo's account, the others identified the island as Madagascar, which became the location for stories about other giant birds.<sup><a href="#">[5]</a></sup> Doubtless, it was Polo's description that inspired <a href="#">Antonio Pgafetta</a>, one of <a href="#">Ferdinand Magellan</a>'s companions, who wrote or had ghost-written an embroidered account of the circumglobal voyage: in Pigafetta's account <sup><a href="#">[6]</a></sup> the home grounds of the roc were the seas of <a href="#">China</a>. Such descriptions captured the imaginations of illustrators, such as <a href="#">Stradanus</a> ca 1590 <sup><a href="#">[7]</a></sup> or <a href="#">Theodor de Bry</a> in 1594 who showed an elephant being carried off in the roc's talons,<sup><a href="#">[8]</a></sup> or showed the roc destroying entire ships in revenge for destruction of its giant egg, as recounted in the fifth voyage of <a href="#">Sinbad the Sailor</a>. <a href="#">Ulisse Adrovandi</a>'s <i>Ornithologia</i> (1599) included a woodcut of a roc with a somewhat pig-like elephant in its talons,<sup><a href="#">[9]</a></sup> but in the rational world of the 17th centry, the roc was regarded more critically.
